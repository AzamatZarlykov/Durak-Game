# Web-based Durak Game

This project is a web-based application designed to play the famous game Durak. Durak is a strategic card game that originated in Russia, and it typically involves two to six players. Unlike most other games, the aim of Durak is not to find a winner, but to find a loser. Players take turns attacking and defending in a series of rounds, with the goal of getting rid of all their cards, and the player left holding cards at the end is declared the fool.
